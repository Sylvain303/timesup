Small, but still efficient, reminder alarm for GNU/Linux

## About

**Lecteur Francophone** : demandez la traduction, je la ferai.


A tiny shell script that allows you to setup an intrusive reminder.

At the given time, a visually annoying reminder will popup after a count down.
When the count down is reached the screen is locked.

A popup will allow you to delay the lock for 1 minute.
